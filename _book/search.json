    "text": "5.1.1 Property Size: The Goldilocks Principle\nWeight: 20%\n\n\nOptimal Range: 0.5-5 acres\nProperties that are “just right” for development.\nNot too small to be economically viable, not too large to be financially unwieldy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Property Size Scoring Curve\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Distribution of Property Sizes in Portfolio\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy This Matters:\n\nToo small (&lt;0.5 acres): Limited development options, high per-unit costs\nOptimal (0.5-5 acres): Maximum flexibility and economic efficiency\nToo large (&gt;10 acres): Requires significant capital, complex phasing\n\nProperty size significantly influences development feasibility, but bigger isn’t always better. Properties under a quarter-acre typically lack the critical mass needed for financially viable development—construction costs per unit rise sharply, and parking or open space requirements become impossible to meet. Conversely, parcels exceeding 10 acres often present unique challenges: they may require complex phasing, demand substantial upfront capital, or face community resistance to density.\n\n\n5.1.2 Current Use: Identifying Low-Hanging Fruit\nWeight: 25%\n\n\nOptimal Use: Vacant or nearly vacant with access to infrastructure\nProperties with minimal current utilization represent immediate opportunities.\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.1: Current Use Scoring Matrix\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent Use\nScore\nRationale\n\n\n\n\nParking Lot\n95\nImmediate development potential, minimal displacement\n\n\nOpen Space\n90\nLow-value use, easy conversion\n\n\nMixed/Other\n60\nVaries by specific circumstances\n\n\nResidence\n40\nDisplacement considerations\n\n\nSchool\n35\nActive community use\n\n\nChurch (primary)\n30\nCore mission function\n\n\nCemetery\n5\nRestricted use, not developable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: Properties by Current Use Type\n\n\n\n\n\nHighest Potential: Parking Lots and Open Space\nNot all church property serves its highest and best use. Surface parking lots represent prime redevelopment opportunities—they’re already cleared and graded, typically have minimal environmental constraints, and often sit underutilized six days per week. A parking lot that serves 200 congregants on Sunday morning but stands empty Monday through Saturday represents an enormous opportunity cost.\nOpen space scores similarly high, particularly when it’s amenity-free lawn rather than programmed recreation or memorial gardens. These properties can be reimagined while potentially retaining some green space within new development.\n\n\n5.1.3 Location Quality: Following the Market\nWeight: 20%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.4: Location Quality Components\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.5: Distribution of Walkability Scores\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Metrics: Walkability Score and Transit Access\nReal estate development fundamentally responds to location. A walkable, transit-rich site commands higher rents, attracts more diverse tenants, and often qualifies for density bonuses or reduced parking requirements—all factors that improve project economics.\nWalkability scores measure proximity to everyday needs: grocery stores, schools, employment centers, healthcare. High walkability (15-20 on our scale) indicates a property can support car-light or car-free households, expanding the potential tenant base to include young professionals, seniors aging in place, and lower-income families for whom car ownership is cost-prohibitive.\nTransit access amplifies these benefits. Properties within a quarter-mile of frequent bus service or half-mile of rail stations can often negotiate reduced parking requirements with municipalities—a significant cost savings when structured parking runs $25,000-$40,000 per space to construct.\n\n\n5.1.4 Financial Need: Aligning Development with Mission\nWeight: 15%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.6: Properties by Financial Need Level\n\n\n\n\n\nPriority: Congregations with Declining Resources\nThis criterion explicitly centers mission over pure market return. Congregations experiencing sustained pledge declines often face a difficult reality: their historic buildings demand expensive maintenance, but shrinking budgets make upkeep increasingly burdensome. Many such congregations sit on valuable real estate that could, through thoughtful development, generate steady income streams while maintaining their worship and ministry.\nA ground lease arrangement, for example, might provide a struggling congregation with $50,000-$150,000 annually in stable income—enough to fund a part-time rector, maintain the building, and sustain core ministries. This approach transforms real estate from a drain on resources into a mission enabler.\nProperties associated with growing congregations score lower not because they lack development potential, but because the urgency is less acute. These communities likely have more options and less immediate financial pressure.\n\n\n5.1.5 Market Potential: Reading Economic Signals\nWeight: 10%\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.2: Market Potential Scoring Criteria\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndicator\nWeight\nHigh Score\nData Source\n\n\n\n\nQCT Status\n40%\nIn Qualified Census Tract\nHUD QCT Maps\n\n\nArea Median Income\n30%\n&gt;$75,000 AMI\nACS 5-Year\n\n\nPopulation Growth\n15%\n&gt;2% annual growth\nCensus\n\n\nHousing Demand\n15%\nHigh demand market\nLocal market data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndicator: Area Median Income and LIHTC Eligibility\nDevelopment must respond to market demand. Properties in higher-income areas (median incomes above $75,000) typically support market-rate housing, ground-floor retail, or mixed-use projects that can cross-subsidize affordable components. These projects attract conventional financing and a broader range of development partners.\nProperties in Qualified Census Tracts (QCTs) gain additional scoring weight because they unlock Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) financing—the nation’s primary mechanism for affordable housing production. LIHTC projects in QCTs receive point advantages in competitive funding rounds, improving their feasibility. For mission-driven institutions committed to affordable housing, QCT properties offer a rare alignment of social impact and financial viability.\n\n\n5.1.6 Zoning: Navigating Regulatory Reality\nWeight: 10%\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.3: Zoning Category Scoring\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZoning Category\nScore\nDevelopment Impact\n\n\n\n\nMixed Use\n90\nMaximum flexibility for housing + retail\n\n\nMulti-Family Residential\n85\nAligned with housing mission\n\n\nCommercial\n70\nMay require use variance for residential\n\n\nSingle-Family Residential\n50\nDensity limitations, rezoning often needed\n\n\nAgricultural\n40\nSignificant restrictions, rural areas\n\n\nConservation\n10\nSevere limitations, unlikely candidate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFavorable: Mixed-Use, Commercial, and Residential Districts\nZoning powerfully shapes what’s buildable and how quickly projects move from concept to construction. Properties zoned for residential or mixed-use development typically offer by-right development opportunities—projects that don’t require lengthy rezoning processes, conditional use permits, or special exceptions.\nConversely, properties in restrictive single-family or conservation districts may require multi-year regulatory processes, neighborhood opposition, and uncertain outcomes. While such projects occasionally succeed, they demand patient capital and sophisticated development partners.\n\n\n5.1.7 Environmental and Regulatory Constraints: Deal-Breakers vs. Speed-Bumps\nWeight: 5% (applied as penalties)\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.4: Constraint Penalties Applied to Development Score\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstraint\nScore Penalty\nMitigation Difficulty\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n100-Year Flood Zone\n-40\nHigh\nExpensive insurance, elevated construction\n\n\nSignificant Wetlands (&gt;25%)\n-35\nHigh\nFederal/state permitting, mitigation required\n\n\nEasements Present\n-30\nModerate\nMay restrict building envelope\n\n\nHistoric District\n-25\nModerate\nDesign review, material requirements\n\n\nModerate Wetlands (10-25%)\n-20\nLow-Moderate\nPotential buildable area reduction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssessment Framework\n\n\n\nDeal-Breakers (Score: 0-30):\n\nExtensive wetlands covering majority of site\nActive floodway designation\nConservation easements prohibiting development\nContaminated sites requiring remediation\n\nSpeed-Bumps (Score: 60-90):\n\nPartial flood zone (can design around)\nHistoric considerations (design flexibility)\nMinor wetlands (avoidable)\nStandard permitting requirements\n\n\n\nThese constraints receive substantial score penalties because they materially affect project feasibility and cost. Properties in 100-year floodplains face expensive flood insurance, elevated construction costs, and increasingly cautious lenders post-climate-change. Development in such areas may be technically possible but financially marginal.\nSignificant wetlands (&gt;25% of parcel) trigger federal and state permitting, potential mitigation requirements, and uncertainty about buildable area. Easements—particularly those held by third parties—can restrict development rights, limit building envelopes, or prevent property subdivision.\nHistoric district designation doesn’t prohibit development but adds layers of design review, material requirements, and timeline uncertainty. Some historic commissions embrace creative contemporary additions; others mandate strict historicism that may conflict with modern construction economics.",

A property might score exceptionally well on size and location but face significant challenges from environmental constraints. Another might have modest physical attributes but represent an urgent opportunity to support a financially stressed congregation.\nThe weighted scoring system allows us to compare apples to oranges—to evaluate whether a small, perfectly-located property in a historic district outweighs a larger, unrestricted site with less market demand. This methodology doesn’t make decisions for stakeholders but rather creates a common language for discussing trade-offs and priorities.\nUltimately, successful church real estate development requires more than high scores. It demands patient capital, mission-aligned partners, engaged congregations, and creative design. But by systematically evaluating these criteria, we can identify the properties where stars align—where market demand, congregational need, and regulatory environment converge to create genuine opportunity.",
