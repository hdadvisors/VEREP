# Analytical Framework

## Development Potential Scoring

Our methodology evaluates six key dimensions:

```{r scoring-visual, fig.height=4}
scoring_components <- tibble(
  Component = c("Property Size", "Current Use", "Location Quality", 
                "Financial Need", "Market Potential", "Zoning"),
  Weight = c(20, 25, 20, 15, 10, 10),
  Description = c(
    "Optimal size for development (0.5-5 acres scores highest)",
    "Underutilized properties (parking lots, open space)",
    "Walkability and transit accessibility",
    "Congregation financial health trends",
    "Area income levels and LIHTC eligibility",
    "Development-friendly zoning classifications"
  )
)

ggplot(scoring_components, aes(x = reorder(Component, Weight), y = Weight)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#445ca9", alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(Weight, "%")), hjust = -0.2, size = 5, 
            color = "#445ca9", fontface = "bold") +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 30)) +
  labs(
    title = "Development Score Components",
    subtitle = "Weighted contribution to final score",
    x = "",
    y = "Weight (%)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 13) +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 16, color = "#445ca9"),
    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()
  )
```

**Constraint Penalties:** Properties receive deductions for flood zones (-40), significant wetlands (-35), easements (-30), and historic district designation (-25).

**Development Tiers**

Properties are classified into five tiers based on composite scores:

-   **Tier 1 (75-100):** High Priority - Immediate development candidates
-   **Tier 2 (60-74):** Strong Potential - Near-term opportunities
-   **Tier 3 (45-59):** Moderate Potential - Requires creative solutions
-   **Tier 4 (30-44):** Limited Potential - Significant barriers exist
-   **Tier 5 (\<30):** Not Recommended - Unsuitable for development
