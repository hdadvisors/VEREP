## Technical Methodology

**Scoring Algorithm Details**

Each property receives scores across six dimensions (0-100 scale), which are then weighted and combined:

1.  **Size Score (20% weight):** Properties between 0.5-5 acres score highest (100 points)
2.  **Use Score (25% weight):** Parking lots (95) and open space (90) score highest
3.  **Location Score (20% weight):** Based on walkability index and transit access
4.  **Financial Score (15% weight):** Congregation pledge trends indicate development need
5.  **Market Score (10% weight):** Area median income and LIHTC eligibility
6.  **Zoning Score (10% weight):** Development-friendly zoning receives 80 points

**Constraint penalties** are applied after the weighted average, with major penalties for: - Flood zones: -40 points - Significant wetlands (\>25%): -35 points\
- Easements: -30 points - Historic districts: -25 points

Final scores are capped between 0-100.

## Data Processing Notes

**Congregation-Parcel Joining:** Properties were matched to congregation data using the `congr_name` field. Properties without matches received neutral financial scores.

**Missing Data Handling:** - Missing data for many data points used in this analysis could be supplemented with related data CGS pulled into their parcel database. This is outlined in more detail earlier in the report but some missing data may still remain. 

**Quality Filters:** - Minimum parcel size: 0.1 acres - Required valid lat/lon coordinates - Valid building years: 1700-2025
