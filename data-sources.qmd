# Data Source Details

The parcel data for this analysis originates from the Center for Geospatial Solutions (CGS) WHOA parcel ownership dataset, which combines cleaned and standardized parcel data from Regrid, property records from ATTOM, and corporate entity registration data from OpenCorporates into a unified national dataset.

CGS identified parcels of interest to VEREP through a multi-step process: geocoding addresses provided by the Episcopal Diocese of Virginia, cross-referencing owner names and mailing addresses against Virginia parcel records, and applying keyword searches specific to Episcopal-affiliated entities. The methodology included manual verification to remove parcels belonging to other dioceses or denominations (such as the Anglican Church in North America or African Methodist Episcopal Church) and to reconcile 572 stacked parcels into 44 distinct records.

The final CGS dataset, completed in February 2025, contains 798 parcels totaling approximately 3,707 acres with an assessed value exceeding $1.79 billion.
