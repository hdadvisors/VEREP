# Executive Summary {.unnumbered}

This analysis examines properties in the Episcopal Diosese of Virginia with fewer than 30 Sunday attendees, focusing on development potential through five key metrics: land value, zoning/density, acreage, environmental limitations, and Qualified Census Tract (QCT) status. This report was done for VEREP (Virginia Episcopal Real Estate Partners) in conjunction with case study projects HDAdvisors is facilitating.

## Key Findings

### Significant Underutilized Assets

Our analysis identified **XX properties** with substantial development potential, representing approximately **\$XX million** in potential value creation.

**Parking lots** (highest development scores): Structured parking with mixed-use above - **Open space parcels**: Well-located vacant land ideal for ground lease arrangements - **Properties with declining congregations**: Sites where development can provide financial stability

### Geographic Distribution

-   **Northern Region**: XX properties (XX% of portfolio)
-   **Southern Region**: XX properties (XX% of portfolio)
-   **Eastern Region**: XX properties (XX% of portfolio)
-   **Western Region**: XX properties (XX% of portfolio)

Development opportunities are distributed across Virginia, with concentrations in:

-   Urban/suburban areas with strong walkability scores
-   Markets with favorable demographics and LIHTC eligibility
-   Transit-accessible locations supporting reduced parking requirements

### Financial Sustainability Imperative
